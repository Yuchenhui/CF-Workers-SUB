# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves refactoring the CF-Workers-SUB project to replace all Chinese variable names with meaningful English equivalents. This will improve code maintainability, readability for international developers, and follow standard coding conventions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all variable names to be in English, so that the code is more accessible to international contributors and follows standard coding practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN all variable names SHALL be in English
2. WHEN a Chinese variable is replaced THEN the English equivalent SHALL maintain the same semantic meaning
3. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN the functionality SHALL remain unchanged
4. WHEN variable names are changed THEN they SHALL follow JavaScript naming conventions (camelCase)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want consistent naming patterns throughout the codebase, so that the code is easier to understand and maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN variables represent similar concepts THEN they SHALL use consistent naming patterns
2. WHEN function names contain Chinese characters THEN they SHALL be replaced with descriptive English names
3. WHEN comments contain variable references THEN they SHALL be updated to match the new variable names
4. WHEN string literals contain Chinese variable references THEN they SHALL be updated accordingly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a code reviewer, I want meaningful variable names that clearly indicate their purpose, so that I can quickly understand the code logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a variable represents subscription data THEN it SHALL have a name that clearly indicates this purpose
2. WHEN a variable represents URL conversion THEN it SHALL have a descriptive name related to URL processing
3. WHEN a variable represents user agent information THEN it SHALL be named appropriately
4. WHEN a variable represents error or exception handling THEN it SHALL have a clear, descriptive name
